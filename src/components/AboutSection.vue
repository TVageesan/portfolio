        Back in 2019, I picked Computing as a H2 Subject on a whim. It was an
        "easy A", as seniors liked to say. Unfortunately (for my sleep
        schedule), Computing became a much bigger part of my life than I ever
        anticipated. Fast forward to today and I've tumbled down the
        <span class="em">rabbit hole</span>
        of building personal projects, various websites and now even a veritable
        garage of various robot cars.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        I've had the privilege of working at <span class="em">G Element</span>,
        a smart building company, where I learnt the fundamentals of applying my
        skills to a professional work environment. I'm also currently working
        with <span class="em">LiftAuth</span>, a startup here in NUS that
        focuses on making robot accessible lifts.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        Through my experiences both inside NUS and out of it, I've developed a
        deep <span class="em">passion</span> for everything and anything
        computer engineering. I believe that Singapore's ongoing transformation
        into a <span class="em">Smart City</span> relies on innovation in these
        technologies, and my experience at <span class="em">LiftAuth</span> has
        sparked a desire to be a part of
        <span class="em">pioneering</span> innovation in this exciting new
        market.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        When I'm not at my computer, you can usually find me at the gym, rock
        climbing, reading or running around
        <span class="em">Faer√ªn</span> trying to defeat the Absolute.
