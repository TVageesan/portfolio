        Back in 2019, I picked Computing as a H2 Subject on a whim. It was an
        "easy A", as seniors liked to say. Unfortunately (for my sleep
        schedule), Computing became a much bigger part of my life than I ever
        anticipated. Fast forward to today and I've tumbled down the rabbit hole
        of building personal projects, various websites and now even a veritable
        garage of various robot cars.

      <p class="about-text">
        I've had the privilege of working at G Element, a smart building
        company, where I learnt the fundamentals of applying my skills to a
        professional work environment. I'm also currently working with LiftAuth,
        a startup here in NUS that focuses on making robot accessible lifts.

      <p class="about-text">
        Through my experiences both inside NUS and out of it, I've developed a
        deep passion for everything and anything computer engineering. I believe
        that Singapore's ongoing transformation into a Smart City relies on
        innovation in these technologies, and my experience at LiftAuth has
        sparked a desire to be a part of this exciting new market not as an
        employee but as a pioneer.

        When I'm not at my computer, you can usually find me at the gym, rock
        climbing, reading or running around Faer√ªn trying to defeat the
        Absolute.
